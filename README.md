Notepad++ plugin for [Elastic Tabstops](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/). 

## Installation
The easiest way to install this is through the PluginManager. You can also download one of the [releases](https://github.com/dail8859/ElasticTabstops/releases) and extract the DLL. Copy this into Notepad++'s plugin directory. This will either be located in the installation directory or under `%APPDATA%\Notepad++\plugins`.

## Development
The code has been developed using MSVC 2013. Building the Release configuration will generate the DLL which can be used by Notepad++. For convenience, MSVC copies the built DLL into the Notepad++ plugin directory.
